# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This project is designed to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on several factors, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest), and the slope of the peak exercise ST segment.

The dataset used in this project contains a total of 12 features, including the target variable - Heart Disease.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on their individual characteristics.

The performance of the model was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve. 

detailed breakdown of the different steps taken throughout the Heart Disease Prediction Project:

# Data Collection:
The first step in any machine learning project is to collect the necessary data. 

# Data Preprocessing:
Once the data was collected, it needed to be preprocessed to prepare it for use in the machine learning model. This included handling missing data, removing duplicate data, and scaling the data to ensure that all features were on the same scale.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA was performed to better understand the relationships between different variables in the dataset. This included generating various plots and charts to visualize the distribution of the data and any correlations between variables.

# Feature Selection and Engineering:
Feature selection and engineering were performed to identify the most important features for the machine learning model. This involved using techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance ranking.

# Model Selection and Training:
A suitable machine learning algorithm was selected based on the problem and dataset characteristics, and the model was trained on the preprocessed dataset.

# Model Evaluation:
The trained model was evaluated using several performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve. This allowed us to determine how well the model was performing and whether any improvements could be made.

# Hyperparameter Tuning:
The hyperparameters of the model were tuned to improve its performance. This involved using techniques such as grid search and randomized search to find the optimal hyperparameters.
